    "There are many ways to download and install Python. As a scientist, my recommendation is definitely through the [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section). Anaconda will have the more popular packages already installed in your Python environment, and it comes with [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/) and [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/). Spyder and Jupyter make working with Python quite easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although I think you'll find `EONR` to be pretty user-friendly, you may find it to your benefit to become a bit more familiar with Python before using `EONR`. If you're a beginner, it will be helpful to read the [Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/) and/or get some hands-on practice with [this Python Tutorial by w3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/).\n",

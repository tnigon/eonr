    "\n",
    "`EONR` is an open-source package written in pure Python. It runs on all major platforms (i.e., Windows, Linux, Mac).\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course you'll need Python because `EONR` is fully implemented in Python. There are many ways to get Python - if you don’t know which one is best for you, you can try [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "To install the latest release of `EONR`, you can use pip:\n",
    "\n",
    "\tpip install eonr\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s also possible to install using conda:\n",
    "\n",
    "\tconda install eonr\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can use pip to install the development version directly from github:\n",
    "\n",
    "\tpip install git+https://github.com/tnigon/eonr\n",
    "\n",
    "Another option is to clone the github repository and install from your local copy. After navigating to the directory of your local copy:\n",
    "\n",
    "\tpip install .\n",
    "\n",
    "The recommended folder directory for the `EONR` package is in the site-packages folder in your Python Path (alongside all other Python packages).\n",

## Tutorial

The major features of `EONR` are:
* Computation of the *Optimum Nitrogen Rate* and the *Maximum Return to Nitrogen* for experimental data fit to the quadratic plateau model (see the [Background page](background.md) for more information).
* Computation of the *Wald*, *Profile-likelihood*, and *Bootstrap* confidence intervals for any `alpha` .
* Adjustment of the economic scenario (via `EONR.cost_n_fert`, `EONR.cost_n_social`, and `EONR.price_grain` in the `EONR` class).

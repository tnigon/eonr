# Introduction

The EONR package was designed to be used with as little Python expertise as possible. However, you may find it to your benefit to become at least a little bit familiar with Python before using EONR. If you're a beginner, I recommend reading the [basic Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/ " Basic Python tutorial") or [Think Python](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/ "Think Python").

With that said, you should be able to make use of EONR by following and executing the commands in the basic tutorial, with the only exception that you substitute in your data.

Code for all the examples is located in your `PYTHONPATH/Lib/site-packages/eonr/examples` folder.
